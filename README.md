- Pandas.ipynb
    - This file contains the Jupyter notebook with all the text and code written in Markdown.
    - The aim was to recreate the website: https://elearn.unigis.at/pluginfile.php/11289/mod_resource/content/23/assignments/Set1/Aufgabe4/PandasIntroduction.html in Markdown.
    - The respective code areas are written in such a way that they also present a result and do not just contain the print command.
